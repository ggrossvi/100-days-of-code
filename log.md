# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Made a form using CSS and HTML.  It's a good start.  I'll be able to hook it up to my backend next week.

**Thoughts:** I am learning CSS.  It took a little longer than expected but I did it. 

**Link to work:** [Itty Bitty Client](https://github.com/ggrossvi/IttyBittyClient)
[Book DAO](http://www.example.com](https://github.com/ggrossvi/BookDaoProject)

**Tomorrow** Start making a card on React that has the book info!
